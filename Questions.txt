1 Why do we have to register jobs to Growth_Venture? They don't do the planning, we do.
2 Is message code and message type code one to one, or the message type code
  optional only? I think it's better that every message has a message type c-
  ode, and it's one to one to the message code.
3 In double mounting scenarios, do we separate two container numbers into two
  fields or concate them with a separator?(the same question applies to cont-
  ainer seal numbers)
4 what is the do number?(already answered, it's a delivery receipe, a confir-
  mation number of goods delivered)
5 we still need extra messages for trip status changing. e.g. The driver will
  send a "Done" message saying that his / her current  trip is done
6 the TM side will confirm that "Done" message and go ahead to change the tr-
  ip status on the schedule control
7 When registering trips from TM to GV, I think we need to incorporate the 
  container number / seal number in the messages. For example, Sea-Export se-
  cond leg or Sea-Import 1st leg, so that the driver knows which container(s)
  to take.
