1 The length restinction is 250 chars, I think it does not include invisible
  fields(the header fields), does it?

1 Can we add planner_id into the Message Head?
2 The legacy problems:
  2.1 Internal vehicle number V.S. LTA registered vehicle number
  2.2 How to deal with known typo in the TripUpdate01 messages from the driver
  2.3 Set default {driver, vehilce} pair base on date period

1 notes to the document from GV: Web Service Interface between GV and Innosys Version 1.0
  1.1 Meaning of Terms
    1.1.1 Are we free to define MC before and after the system is implemented?
    1.1.2 Do we use JN + SN or just SN to identify a job trip?
  1.2 Web service message format
    1.2.1 We can send all messages in your proposed format, which is MC + PM + 
      JN + SN + Message(optional)
  1.3 Message codes 
    1.3.1 So your side have only two message codes: TI01 and TU01
    1.3.2 And each of the above two message codes has a sub-field, question:
      any restrictions of the sub-field, such as length?
    1.3.3 Where is sub-fields of a MC is stored? We only allocated 4 chars for MC.
  1.4 In TU01 messages, there's only 1 container number and seal number, how to cater
    the case where 2 containers are carried in one trip.

1 Why do we have to register jobs to Growth_Venture? They don't do the planning, we do.
2 Is message code and message type code one to one, or the message type code
  optional only? I think it's better that every message has a message type c-
  ode, and it's one to one to the message code.
3 In double mounting scenarios, do we separate two container numbers into two
  fields or concate them with a separator?(the same question applies to cont-
  ainer seal numbers)
4 what is the do number?(already answered, it's a delivery receipe, a confir-
  mation number of goods delivered)
5 we still need extra messages for trip status changing. e.g. The driver will
  send a "Done" message saying that his / her current  trip is done
6 the TM side will confirm that "Done" message and go ahead to change the tr-
  ip status on the schedule control
7 When registering trips from TM to GV, I think we need to incorporate the 
  container number / seal number in the messages. For example, Sea-Export se-
  cond leg or Sea-Import 1st leg, so that the driver knows which container(s)
  to take.
