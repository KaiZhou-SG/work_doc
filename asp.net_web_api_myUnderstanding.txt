  My Understanding of the ASP.NET Web API Framework

  In the era of the Internet, services can be delivered via Internet. HTTP is one set of the Internet pro-
tocols, it's full name is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol.
  HTTP does not only transfer data, it also has verbs, which are: Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete. So
that data can also be created, retrieved, updated and deleted.
  ASP.NET Web API Framework makes use of those functionalities of the HTTP protocol, and provides a lot of
wrapper classes for convenience while creating a service or consuming a service via HTTP protocol.
  ASP.NET Web API Framework has its own structure, the MVC structure, while V(the View) is not heavily used
and M(the Model) is the place where business objects are placed, and C(the Controller) is the place where
HTTP requests are matched and dispatched to the M(the business objects), and processed data are returned to
the HTTP calling party(the HTTP Client).
  Routing:
    Routing is to redirect the HTTP requests from HTTP Clients to the correct Actions(in Controller). There
are two ways to configure such routings so far as I know:
    a) add the route object to the routeTable object one for each Action in the Controller
    b) add an route attribute in front of each Action  
  ASP.NET Web API Http Configuration:
  Places am I still not so clear:
    a) How to handle lots of HTTP requests asynchronously
    b) How to seralize / deseralize objects when passing them back and forth HTTP Requests and Responses
    c) The common Web API related classes
