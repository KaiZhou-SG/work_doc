Overview:
1 Modeling languages are used to specify, visualize, construct, and document systems.
2 UML has become the standard method for modeling software systems.
3 UML has a strict terminology for just about every aspect of modeling. This is necessary to reduce
  ambiguity and confusion as much as possible.
  However, in everyday use some terms are used interchangeably with others that have completely different
  meanings in UML. A classic example of this is operation and method.
4 Static modeling captures the physical structur of a piece of software:
  >> Class diagrams
  >> Package diagrams
  >> Composite structures
  >> Component diagrams
  >> Deployment diagrams
  >> Use case diagrams
  >> Statechart diagrams
  >> Activity diagrams
  >> Interaction diagrams
