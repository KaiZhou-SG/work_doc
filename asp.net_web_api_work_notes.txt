1 since there are a lot of conventions / configurations, pay attentation to the details where there're
  conventions / configurations or formats; sometimes it's just a small typo
2 the routing mechanism is not so clever, create route templates that are at least easy to be distinguish 
  by naked eyes
3 debuging is so important, be smart, be obserative while gaining the experience
4 [Route("url")] is much easier than Http Verbs or [ActionName("action")] or any other kind of mapping /
  routing; I'm curious why nobody even mentioned that.
  Use Http Verbs are just too restrictive, use ActionName + RouteTemplate is just too trick, it will kill
  you when you're not experienced, just avoid them, use [Route("url")]
5 it really needs time to try and summarize before you're comfortable with asp.net web api 2
