update 2015-04-11
1 mappings of the message code system between GV and IPL:
  a GV message code system has two levels:
    a1 MessageCode
    a2 Sub-fields
  b IPL message code system has three levels:
    b1 MessageCode
    b2 MessageTypeCode
    b3 Description
  c mappings
    MessageCode <--> MessageCode, one to one
    MessageTypeCode(IPL) <--> MessageCode(IPL), many to one
    MessageTypeCode(IPL) <--> Description(IPL), one to one
    Sub-fields(GV) <--> Description(IPL), one to one

2 new design according to the document(2015-02-02) GV sent yesterday(2015-04-10)
  2.1 add carrierRefNo and MsgSubCode to MessageHead class --> so SE1stHead and SE2ndHead classes are to be updated
  2.2 add a new class: MessageBody, put MsgId, ScheduleDate, TripStartTime, TripEndTime, MsgTypeCode,
     PlannerId, MsgTime and Remark into this class
  2.3 SE1stLegBody and SE2ndLegBody inherit from MessageBody --> so SE1stLegBody and SE2ndLegBody are
    going to be updated
  2.4 SI1stLegBody and SI2ndLegBody inherit from MessageBody --> so SI1stLegBody and SI2ndLegBody are
    going to be updated
  2.5 All the related DAL are going to be updated
  2.6 The design of MsessageType class changed:
    2.6.1 It now contains three fields: MsgCode, MsgSubCode, Details 
    2.6.2 MsgCode only has two values: TI01 and TU01
    2.6.3 For TI01, MsgSubCode will be COL, EXP, IMP, RTN, FWD
    2.6.4 For TU01, MsgSubCode is optional
    2.6.5 For TI01, Details is optional
    2.6.6 For TU01, Details contains 01,02,...,07 + value pairs, separated by ~ 
          e.g. 01 --> no value
          e.g. 02=PCIU9985660~03=9957~04=TRC448Y --> three pairs
  2.7 there are still msg_id in the class and database tables, for purposes of:
    2.7.1 we still decide not to mix up all kinds of instruction messages(COL, EXP, IMP, FWD) into one
      database table, there're a lot of potential risk by mixing them up  
    2.7.2 we still separate a message into head and body, and how a message body is going to find its head,
      by msg_id, msg_code, msg_subCode
    2.7.3 I'll experiment making msg_id auto increasing 1, instead of manually generate
