 db switches and config files are used for different scenarios:

>> put these information in the config files

1 sql server related:
  a) physical server ip address
  b) sql server ip address 
  c) sql server instance name
  d) sql server database name
  e) login id and password of the above database

2 web service related:
  a) web service base address

3 UI configurations:
  a) form_id
  b) control_id
  c) property name + property value

4) conclusion:
  a) the config file is the first external information that an application approaches
    while it starts up, otherwise, the application will fail to start
  b) all installations have exactly the same keye in the config file(only the values 
    are different        
  c) confidential information will not be placed in the config file, as it's plain-text 
  d) config file is relatively static 
  e) different value of a same key does not mean a different logic, the logic is always
    the same, such as login to database, it's only using different values to perform
    the logic

>> put these information in db switches:

1 confidential information that don't want the user to view or modify
2 installation based switches, different installation may have different switches
3 logic will change based on the value of switches, or even the presence of the 
    switches
4 the total of switches are quite dynamic, new keys are offten added, and every
    new switch means a different logic branch
